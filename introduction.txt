Hi, my name is Romeo Newo, and I’m a passionate Pathway learner who’s deeply interested in programming and technology. I enjoy exploring how software works, solving problems through code, and continuously pushing myself to learn new skills. Whether it’s building small projects or diving into complex concepts, I find excitement in every step of the journey.

Outside of coding, I love playing video games. They not only help me relax but also inspire my creativity and problem-solving abilities. I believe that both gaming and programming share a common thread—strategic thinking, persistence, and the thrill of mastering challenges.
